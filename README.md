# Monero daemon package
**[Version de este README en espa√±ol.](./README_es.md)**
## Features
- Very simple instalation. Takes roughly 6 clicks total to install monerod.
- Automatically makes onion and i2p addresses to use them for monerod.
- Supports Spanish (WIP) and English.
## Install
In the web app just scroll to the bottom and put this repository's url.

Note: The requirements are lower than they should be because otherwise yunohost doesn't let you install the package and try it. You need roughly 80\~GB for a pruned node and 220\~GB for a non pruned one, alongside 4GB of ram.
