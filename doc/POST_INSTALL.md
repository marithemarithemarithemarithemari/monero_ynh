The monero daemon is a really resource intensive app while syncing but once you're fully synced it's resourse usage should lower dramatically. You shouldn't use your wallet with it until it's fully synced because if you do you might get wrong information. The blockchain is stored in `__DATA_DIR__` and the monero binaries in `__INSTALL_DIR__`.
